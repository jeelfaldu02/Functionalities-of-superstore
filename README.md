# Functionalities-of-superstore
I used Data Structures and the OOPs concept
in this project. Explored different pillars
of OOPs to ensure only managers can access
the inventory. Used hashing with chaining
to store the items in the stock. Also created
other classes of billing, inventory, customer
details, etc.
